## Introduction

- This is **activity 0** uses the tools below to create a Hello World project.
     - Express
     - NodeJS
     - Visual studio code
     - TypeScript

## Screenshots

![Node version](../activity0/images/nodeVersion.png)
- 1a) Checking the node version installed on local device.

<br>

![NPM version](../activity0/images/npmVersion.png)
- 1b) Checking the NPM version installed on local device.


In the screenshots above, I installed NodeJS and NPM. Then I checked in the terminal if they were installed by checking the version.


<br><br>

![NodeJS app console](../activity0/images/nodeJsAppConsole.png)
- 1c) Running the app.js in the terminal.

<br>

I created a .js file called app which console prints Hello World to the console. Then I saved it in a folder called hello. I opened a terminal and changed directory into the hello folder and ran the app.js by typing in “node app.js.” This returned the code to the terminal.

![NodeJS browser](../activity0/images/nodeJsAppBrowser.png)
- 1d) Accessing localhost view

<br>

- 1d) Accessing console view

<br>

I started a local server to view on my local host the javascript code being printed to the page as a response. I created an app.js file then ran the commands in the terminal “npm init, npm install express.” 
To start the NodeJS server I ran “node app.js.” Then I stopped the server with CTRL + C. 

<br><br>

![Nodemon browser](../activity0/images/nodemonbrowser.png)
- 1e) Changed response string.

<br>

Using Nodemon saves time from having to type CTRL + C to stop and node app.js to run the server every time you need to edit your code. 

<br><br>

![TypescriptBrowser](../activity0/images/typescriptBrowser.png)
- 1f) Ran "app.ts".

<br>

I created a simple TypeScript project that runs in the web browser.  

<br><br>

![Typescript comments](../activity0/images/appTypescriptComments.png)
- 1g) App.ts commented code.

<br>

I setup a Node.js project with TypeScript. First I created a new project folder MusicAPI and initialized it with npm init. Next, I installed Express and its TypeScript type definitions. Then I installed TypeScript as a development tool and generated a tsconfig.json file. The src folder was created to store the source code called app.ts containing an Express app. The single route / responds with the Hello world welcome text. The ts-node directly compiled and ran the TypeScript file without building it first. 

## Conclusion

- I learned how to install NodeJS, Express, VS Code, and TypeScript.
     - The 3 applications created were a NodeJS, Express, and TypeScript applications.
